# M16HonorsSeminarPaper
Vishal Dandandamudi

For EC 89 (seminar class attached to EC ENGR M16 Spring 2025). 

Covered mordern tools in hardware development toolchains and their pros/cons/how they work/etc. 


Here is a slide show for a mid-quarter presentation that I think goes over some fundamental concepts pretty well (way better than the paper at least...) for beginners/newbies to Hardware Description Languages or people who just want to explore higher level tools in modern/new hardware development toolchains.
